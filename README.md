# latex-numbering-class
A novel class to introduce automatic LaTeX equation numbering and hyperlinking to streamlit web apps. The aim is to mimic academic papers composed in LaTeX which often include sequentially numbered equations referenced by unique identifiers. The digital versions of these papers also often include inline hyperlinking via the LaTeX package `hyperref` which allows very easy cross referencing.
